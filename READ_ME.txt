Hello!
This project was created by Benjamin Tropper and Marlene Dirnberger.
Unfortunately, we had some serious problems with the collaboration via GitHub at short notice. We didn't know how else to help but to create a new repository. That's why there are only so few commits. Furthermore, we decided to push the changes from only one local repository, which is why there are no commits from Mr. Tropper's account. 
However, we have divided the work for the project fairly, so the history is not representative of that.
I hope you will take this into account when it comes to the requirement for a proper amount of commits.
